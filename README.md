This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to silent write failures in the Firebase Realtime Database. The bug involved data writes that sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed without any error messages. The solution focuses on implementing more robust error handling and data confirmation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency.  See bug.js for the problematic code and bugSolution.js for the improved version.
